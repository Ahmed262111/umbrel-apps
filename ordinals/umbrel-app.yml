releaseNotes: >-
  ðŸš¨ This update requires a full re-indexing of the ord database to prepare for upcoming runes!
  This is handled for you automatically by Umbrel when you update the app. 


  Advanced users: running ord commands via the Terminal has now been simplified. From inside the ord container, simply type the command you want to run as listed in the ord help menu. For example, to create a wallet, run `ord wallet create`.
